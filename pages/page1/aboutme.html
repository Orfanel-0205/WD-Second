My name is Clifford Psalm Orfanel, and I am a seasoned Web Developer with over a decade of experience in creating dynamic and responsive web applications. I specialize in front-end development, bringing a keen eye for design and a commitment to delivering intuitive user experiences.

        <p>
            I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Technology, which has provided me with a solid foundation in programming principles and software engineering. My journey in the tech world began with a passion for coding and a drive to solve complex problems, which has guided my career through various roles and projects.

            Over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Vue.js. My professional experience includes working with diverse teams to develop scalable web solutions for both startups and established enterprises. I pride myself on my ability to adapt to new technologies quickly and my dedication to staying current with industry trends.

            Beyond my technical expertise, I am known for my strong communication skills and my ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. Whether it’s working closely with designers to bring a vision to life or liaising with clients to understand their needs, I always strive to exceed expectations.

        <p>
            Outside of work, I am an avid learner and enjoy exploring new tech innovations, attending industry conferences, and participating in hackathons. When I’m not coding, you can find me hiking, reading, or spending time with family and friends.
